# Denmark is getting rainier

In this repository I examine the development in precipitation in Denmark. During the past decade, precipitation has increased by almost 20 percent. I look into the yearly rainfall, how rainy each month has been on average and compare different historical periods spanning from the late 19th century to 2020.
