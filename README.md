# Denmark is getting rainier

In this repository I examine the development in precipitation in Denmark. During the past decade, precipitation has increased by almost 20 percent. I look into the yearly rainfall, how rainy each month has been on average and compare different historical periods spanning from the late 19th century to 2020. 

The content of this notebook is presented in the article [Has It Always Been This Rainy?](https://laurabejder.com/rain/)

### Data collection

The historical data was collected by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). It can be downloaded as a zip file [here](https://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/Rapporter/2021/DMIRep21-02.zip). 
This repository only contains the files used for this project but the original data folder also has information on daily precipitation for other parts of Denmark as well as sunlight, temperature etc.
